                            India has more than 50+ State Boards and other boards like CBSE, ICSE and NIOS. Each board has its separate curriculum, education techniques and facilities.

                            CBSE VS STATE BOARD
                            
                            
                            :::::{INTRODUCTION}::::::
                            
                            CBSE (established in 1962)
                            
                            The central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) is the national level board with a huge network. It is managed by the union government of India. CBSE is found in 25 countries, with more than 20,000+ schools following it.
                            
                             CBSE follows NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) books.
                            
                                        
                            STATE BOARDS:
                            
                             As India has 52 state boards in the country.  The network of the state boards is limited to the respective state only (in most cases). The state board is under control of the Ministry of Education of that state or union territory. Generally, in a particular state the number of students studying in State Board is far more than number of CBSE Students in that State.
                            
                            Most of the State Boards have their own curriculum and textbooks. But now-a-days many State Boards follow NCERT books for some subjects.
                            For example: State board of Gujarat, UP board, board of Himachal State, Tripura etc.
                            
                            
                            :::::{Analysis}:::::
                            Let's have a comparison!!
                            
                            1. Course or streams offered:
                            
                                                                CBSE:
                            
                             In CBSE you get a chance to learn 1 foreign language.
                            Generally, CBSE does not teach Regional Language.
                            In 11th commerce, the option of Commerce with Mathematics is also given in which mathematics which can be applied in commerce is taught.
                            The courses are much more flexible than State Boards.
                            
                            
                                                            STATE BOARDS
                            
                            The state board does not have the option of commerce with maths.
                            State Boards generally do not have the option of a foreign language.
                            Generally in state boards, you have to learn 3 languages: English, Hindi and the local language of the state.
                            
                            
                            2. Medium of Instruction.
                            CBSE
                            
                            CBSE offered you to study in English medium or Hindi medium.
                                                                         
                            STATE BOARDS

                            Every state board has a different syllabus so it’s tough to generalize all.
                            
                            
                            4. Toughness of Scoring Marks

                            So after analyzing this data and taking views of some students we came to a conclusion that some state boards are tougher to scorer marks, but in most cases CBSE is easier for scoring marks.
                            
                            
                             
                            5. Other factors and opportunities:
                            
                            CBSE
                            
                            1). CBSE gives a child the exposure to many type of national competitions, programs and events.
                            2). CBSE curriculum also teaches about Global History and Economics which is generally not taught in State Boards.
                            3). But, a child who studies in CBSE is less likely to understand the regional culture fully and also less likely to make more local friends. Although this may seem insignificant but many a times the child feels lonely and feels that his/her childhood did not have that spark.
                            4). Also, the child may not learn the regional language very well. 
                            
                            
                                                                        STATE BOARDS
                            
                            1. The curriculum is constructed to teach students about their state’s economy, geography, culture, history etc.
                            2. Generally students of state board get opportunity to participate in all state level competitions, programs and events.
                            3. More attention is given to their regional language so that students can learn things in their mother tongue.
                            4. History is more based on their state culture and other regional events.
                            5. Student becomes more familiar to the regional culture, language and gets more opportunity to make local friends as number of students in state boards is generally more.
                            
                            
                            6. Fees and Expenses:
                            
                                                                             CBSE
                            
                             Usually, the fees of CBSE schools are higher than the state boards.
                            
                            CBSE School fees. (Private school).

                            It all depends on the school and city.Also, fees in government schools are lower than in private schools.
                            
                            
                            
                            STATE BOARDS
                            
                             Fees are lower in-state boards as compared to CBSE.

                             Usually, such a fee range is seen in the state boards. The rest depends on the state and the particular school.
                            
                            
                            Benefits of CBSE
                            
                            1. Focused design and practical approach of the curriculum.
                            
                            2. NCERT books help CBSE’s students to score more marks in exams like UPSC, NEET, JEE, KVPY etc.
                            
                            3. They update their textbooks in every 2-3 years.

                            5. This board is good for parents who have to migrate from one state to another. So that their child does not suffer from the different-different syllabus.
                            
                            
                            Disadvantages:
                            
                             1. Sometimes the CBSE board becomes 'rot learning'.
                             2. The curriculum is not focused on state, regional and local culture. So, a child can sometimes remain ignorant about our proud Culture and Heritage.
                             3. Sometimes being in CBSE makes a student just a studying machine due to societal pressure and the student may not be able to unleash his/her potential. Even many times students could not pursue their hobby and feels lonely.
                             4. He could miss out the “School-Life Moments” which are an integral part of anyone’s life.   
                             5.  This board is more expensive than State boards.
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            Benefits of State Boards
                            
                            1. This is a good board for students who want to know about the state's resources and those who want to serve the state.
                            
                            2. The State Board is ideal for parents who do not plan to go from their state to another state.
                            
                            3. The State Board syllabus will help you very much in their state-level competitive examinations.
                            
                            4. The marks of the State Board are useful for going to the good colleges in that state.
                            
                            5. Fees are less compared to CBSE.
                            
                            6. Materials about the curriculum of the state board are easily available in that state compared to CBSE.
                            
                            
                            
                            Disadvantages:
                            
                            1. The curriculum is not centralized, making it difficult for those parents who have to change the state due to their jobs.
                            
                            2. Sometimes there is just "Rote Learning" in some subjects.
                            
                            3. The course is not made keeping in mind the competitive exams.
                            
                            4. The syllabus is not frequently updated.
                            
                            5. As syllabus is more focused on State Culture a child may not get the exposure to National And International Studies.
                            
                            
                            What should you choose?
                            
                            That’s a good question but the answer depends on various factors like – Nature of Parents’ Job, Earnings, Child’s future goals, in which City and which area you are residing, and also various little things.
                            If parents are having frequently transferring job then they should surely go for CBSE as it is the best option in this case. If a student is surely aiming to study in some famous college of the state only then the preferred choice is State Board. So, one needs to think about many aspects before making any decision and then only come to a logical conclusion.
                            
                            
                            Our results on this battle!!
                            
                            From our analysis and study we come to a conclusion that State Board is Necessary for a Child’s Holistic and Cultural Development whereas CBSE is necessary for a child’s Academic and Professional Development.
                            
                            We would suggest that during initial years at school (i.e upto 8th standard) the student should be kept in State Boards so that in childhood the student learns the great culture of his/her state and country. Also the student develops understanding for Regional culture, beliefs and language.
                            But after 8th standard when a student gets serious about his career and academics he/she must be transferred to CBSE so that he can gain exposure to national and international academics and studies. Also the student will be able to compete in many national competitions and events.
                            Also, in most state boards getting marks is tougher. So, being in CBSE will be somewhat easier to score marks and thus good marks can make a good impression overall.      
                            
                            Conclusion:
                            
                            This was just our suggestion we do recommend and expect that you must do own analysis and research and also consider various factors before coming to any conclusion.
